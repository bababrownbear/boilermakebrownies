# boilermakebrownies

Our team for boilermake6 is comprised of 1 second year pre-med student, 2 seniors completing their bachelors in Computer Science, and 1 software engineer completing his masters in Computer Science.

The project entails gathering choice info from Liberty Mutual's Shine API for 20 cities in the US.

Given these datapoints, a user will login to our app and be presented with 2 random cities and will be asked to vote which city would they rather live in given the information provided about the city.

This vote will get saved to the landing page of the app where any user can see and add their comment or vote.

We've divvied up the tasks as external API wrangler, 2 frontend devs, 1 devops/backend.

We are using Angular 7, MongoDB Stitch, and Librerty Mutual Shine API.

We've structured our Angular application into components, services, modules, and models.

We followed MongoDB's Stitch's templates for database rules.

We're using Firebase/GCP for hosting.

We bought the domain using domain.com.
